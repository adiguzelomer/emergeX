# How to contribute to EmergeX

## Our goal

We love what we do and we love to experiment a lot.

We are sharing these experiments because we hope they help others. We love to receive feedback and would also welcome contributions.

## Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ciscoemerge/emergeX/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Contributing with comments on articles

Most of our experiments are covered in articles on [Our Blog](https://medium.com/cisco-emerge).

One way to contribute is to comment on Medium or to share the article.

## Contributing with code

* Fork the repo.
* Make changes.
* Submit a pull request.

Please always add clear comments to your pull requests.
We will do what we can to review all the pull requests within a few days.

You can read docs on [how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you need help.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it :)
